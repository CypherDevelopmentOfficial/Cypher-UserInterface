# Cypher
We are not here to compete with Cydia in any way. Anyone that says: "Screw Cydia, Just use Cypher instead" should be learned respect. Everyone deserves the same treatment, and any package manager must be seen with respect.
First there was Installer, then there was Cydia. Later, some alternatives were made like Sileo, Icy, and Installer 5. We do not want to be seen as an alternative or successor. We keep our project opensource, and soon we will ensure Saurik is allowed to use anything we make and use it for himself, as long as we are still allowed to use it. 
## By CypherDevelopment

Cypher is meant to be a package manager focussed on giving the community *anything* it pleases.
We have chosen to give the frontend user the choice to use a pre-compiled list of sources. These sources will fix any and all issues with the Top Listed things. But the frontend user sometimes is a real poweruser and wants to use sources nobody else is using. Therefore we chose to also give the user the ability to control their own list
> Using this as a tool for piracy is not allowed. We do not condone actions from pirates in any way. If you do not have the money to pay for a tweak, or the provided payment methods are out of reach in your country, please contact the developer of the package and explain your situation.

### Actions to fight Piracy

We know painfully well that pirates nowadays have their flags planted anywhere. We have and will be assigning people as ```CypherPolice``` to mark sources as pirates. If a source is marked as a pirate and you want to add it, you will get a pop-up that reminds the user that we are not liable for any damage the pirate source causes. It will also help us enforce the following policy: If the user has a package from a pirate source, or got an illegal copy of a tweak, the user cannot reach out to us. Developer contact trought the application will also be marked on ```alledged pirate```.

As the backend will be opensource, we must ensure that security is maximal. This means that it might take a while for the backend to be published. We need to make sure **all** exits are covered. We do not want a pirate to be able to hijack our service, and remove the list of piracy repos, or worse, add piracy repos to the Pre-set repos.

A developer who actually is hosting piracy tweaks will get a banner like: ```Developer lost credibility due to piracy``` for a year. These developers will **not be alligeable** for the featured page.

### Cypher Developers Program: a beautiful tool.
Cypher is meant to create a beautiful symphony of helping *both the EndUser as the Developer*. For the developer, testing is of uttermost importance if a tweak is targetted for a larger audience; tweaks that did not get the required testing, stress handling, or even version testing, are mainly broken and did never get the fame they deserve. We want to ensure tweaks can easily be tested, so that a developer is being helped as much as possible.

> Most users will be allowed to join into the developer program. This will add multiple tweaks to their system, which will contain a reporting tool John NemECis is writing. It is meant to be as usefull as possible. At some stage there will be a new extention added that doesnt just add a RespringProgress-esque progress bar at respring, but there will also be a button to enter SafeMode directly to ensure an user cannot get stuck in RespringLoop.

The Beta Program will most likely expand as fast as our services grow. Therefore we will be giving roles out equally. A Pirate, or Users that installed stuff from a Piracy Repo will automatically be kicked from the Beta Program. If a tweak tries to mess with our developer safety valves, it will imediately be modified, removed, or the device will be kicked out of the Beta Program.

> To get in the Beta Program as User _(not the developer. They will get anything they need imediately, although they will not get the reporting tools. They can request to also be a Beta Tester if they want to test other's works. And a developer can choose to give a certain user BetaTesting capabilities for their tweaks. Or ban another user.)_  you can request this from our Discord Server by going to Helpers>#Join. There will be a line drawn who gets it and who will have to wait. This is dependent on the members using Cypher. As long as we are below 100 users, the allowance rate will be (90 members) 100% until the capacity is reached for that amount. Afterwards it will be shrinking until the point that when we reach 1000 users, we will have 400 Beta Testers. And that will be the perfect world; 40% of the population as beta testers. **BUT** if you make 3 reports that get flagged as "Junk", you will be kicked.

Many Developers are held back to test some tweaks. This either is because they are scared the paid package gets taken by an user, and published elsewere. This is really understandable, even relatable. Therefore we will build a tool **alongside this package manager** for *tweak developers* to ensure that a package cannot be redistributed. **This Toolbox** will be kept **Closed Source** to the *Public eye*. Some developers that The Maintainer chooses, will have access to the sourcecode of this tool.

#### Early-Access to Cypher
Since we will be all OpenSource, anyone can join the Early-Access. Unfortunately, this causes some significant risks when we will be adding new functions on the daily.
