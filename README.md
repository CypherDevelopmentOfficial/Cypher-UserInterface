# Cypher
## By CypherDevelopment

Cypher is meant to be a package manager focussed on giving the community *anything* it pleases.
We have chosen to give the frontend user the choice to use a pre-compiled list of sources. These sources will fix any and all issues with the Top Listed things. But the frontend user sometimes is a real poweruser and wants to use sources nobody else is using. Therefore we chose to also give the user the ability to control their own list
> Using this as a tool for piracy is not allowed. We do not condone actions from pirates in any way. If you do not have the money to pay for a tweak, or the provided payment methods are out of reach in your country, please contact the developer of the package and explain your situation.

### Actions to fight Piracy

We know painfully well that pirates nowadays have their flags planted anywhere. We have and will be assigning people as ```CypherPolice``` to mark sources as pirates. If a source is marked as a pirate and you want to add it, you will get a pop-up that reminds the user that we are not liable for any damage the pirate source causes. It will also help us enforce the following policy: If the user has a package from a pirate source, or got an illegal copy of a tweak, the user cannot reach out to us. Developer contact trought the application will also be marked on ```alledged pirate```.
As the backend will be opensource, we must ensure that security is maximal. This means that it might take a while for the backend to be published. We need to make sure **all** exits are covered. We do not want a pirate to be able to hijack our service, and remove the list of piracy repos, or worse, add piracy repos to the Pre-set repos.
A developer who actually is hosting piracy tweaks will get a banner like: ```Developer lost credibility due to piracy``` for a year. These developers will **not be alligeable** for the featured page.

### Cypher Developers Program: a beautiful tool.
