// This is the first part I will be seriously writing with certainty it is for the backend.
// This will most likely be used to check if repositories are online or offline.
// A replacement will be needed later, but i have to study apt before i can do this.
// If i learn how Apt works and can be implemented, I will use this to connect to a server. This method will be used to check if the repo is online. If Apt cant get any packages, it will be a "Under Maintanance" (yellow bulb), and if Error, Offline (red bulb), and if packages are being found, Online (Green bulb). Or dunno. whatever, it will be visible to the end user.

//// Since I am new, I will be documenting anything I hope to reach. One day I wont need to anymore.
////// When Niklas gives me the Missing Link (an apt replacement), this will be used instead.
